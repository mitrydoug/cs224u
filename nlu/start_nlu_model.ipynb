Their good intentions bring about delightful situations you will love.\"  -- Shari Brennan, Simegen.com\"This romantic comedy has all the elements--engaging characters, an adorable tale, and scenes that make you laugh out loud.\"  -- Laura Baker, award-winning author, Legend\\tBook #1 in the Fairy Godmother series\\tHolly Fuhrmann lives in Erie, PA and lives with one husband, four children, and one drooling Old English Mastiff, which makes her a leading authority on sanity-challenged writers.', \"Dream come true or worst nightmare? Grace Macguire can't figure out what in the world is going on, when three of the characters she'd created for recurring roles in her romance novels suddenly seem to come to life and decided that *she* is their next 'Cinderella Story.'On the pretense of doing research, Grace enlists the help of psychiatrist Dr. Max Aaronson, (and the fairy godmothers' choice for Grace's life-mate.) in an effort to really help her over her sudden bout of weird visions.Throw in some vile step-relatives and a really heinous individual who sees dollar signs in Grace's eyes and who, in my opinion, got off way too lightly and you have the makings for a enjoyable night of reading. I'd have liked the book to have been a bit longer, so that the characters could have been fleshed out more and the storyline beefed up, but all in all, a delightful story.\", \"It is a light hearted read, very Mills and Boone romance with a bit of quirky fairytale myth thrown in for free. It is exactly right if you are looking for an uncomplicated book that will make you smile and doesn't need you to work out the quantum physics of time travel or the validity of vampiric lifestyle choices. I think the concept would do well as a Disney or TV afternoon film. Fun read.\", \"Holly Fuhrman's MAD ABOUT MAX is a delightful blend of romance, humor, and fantasy.  A writer doubts her sanity when her own creations come to life -- and the resulting conversations will have readers laughing out loud.MAD ABOUT MAX is a perfect ending to a stressful day.  I highly recommend it!\", 'Although the dialog is well written and I was excited about the fairytale premise, I felt like I was watching a bad Lifetime movie.  You know the ones where you just want to throw up your hands and rewrite the screenplay.  If you are into that Lifetime super, sticky-sweet romance that is so predictable, then this is your romance book.  As for me I like some edgyness to my kidnappings and not the over the top psycho that deserves laughs more than shudders and gets off scot free in the end.I think this author has promise if she would please tighten up the plot and leave off some of the syrup.  Since this one was written in 2000 she may have done just that.', \"If you've always loved &quot;Cinderella&quot; and were/are a fan of the old TV series, &quot;Bewitched,&quot; then MAD ABOUT MAX is the book for you. As always in one of Ms.Fuhrmann's books, humor abounds in this tale of  Grace, a romance writer whose fictional characters come to life--three  fairy godmothers who are almost as bumbling as Samantha Steven's befuddled  aunt and every bit as loveable. The trio of well-meaning and marvelously  magical ladies set to work immediately on making Grace over and setting her  up with the perfect Price Charming for her.  Max is a psychiatrist so  handsome and charming, you'll wish you could spend some time on his couch.  Sit back and enjoy this delightful fantasy, secure in knowing the fun  doesn't stop with Max and Grace. Fern, Myrtle and Blossom will be at work  again in the upcoming sequel: MAGIC FOR JOY.  I can't wait.\", \"Grace Kelly MacGuire is a romance novelist.  She writes a series in which a trio of eccentric fairy godmothers help couples find love.  Suddenly, she finds that the trio has come to life, and only she can see them.  Naturally, she goes for psychiatric help.  She picks the doctor most likely to be old and grandfatherly, Dr. Artemus Aaronson, who turns out to be gorgeous and young, all this after winning a free makeover from a radio station she doesn't listen to.  Later she wins a new wardrobe, obviously the fairies have been busy.  She has both an evil stepmother and stepsister who want her trust fund and an evil would be husband, who wants her money.  All in all this is a really funny book, and I look forward to finally reading the rest of the series, Max's brother and sister are featured.\", \"This is a very light, short (around 2800 locations) read.  It's far from perfect.  I got a kick out of the reviewer who said he or she didn't have a problem with believing in the fairies but couldn't believe in the relationship.  I agree, lots in this book just happened too fast, it needed to be longer and more developed.But it was still entertaining.  The three bumbling fairy godmothers were a hoot.  As was watching Grace trying to figure out if she was crazy or not because she could see and hear them.  The stepmother and stepsister characters were delightfully evil.If you can suspend all disbelief and forgive the shortcomings, it's a nice little HEA romance that's worth the read.\"]\n"

We follow the results when a bear, a bull, and a baboon blow bubbles and bike backwards.  What happens?  Well, they bump into all kinds of things.  And the more they bump, the more absurd the book gets and the more fun it truly is.As I said, we all loved this book.  It was clever and charming and so out there you can't help but laugh at it.

Its main characters are firefighters, trying to get dressed for the big parade, but they don't have the correct amount of buttons. They have a variety of sizes and shapes but they must be able to sort them in such a way that each firefighter has a set of four. There is a typo in the beginning that talks about the number os sets - it says there needs to be four sets of three instead of three sets of four, but other than that, it's just a great little book. My little one wants it read repeatedly each night. What a great way to start your toddler off right, particularly if you have a boy who loves firetrucks and firefighters! Highly recommend!\", 'We try to use MathStart books with our preschoolers as much as we can. In this one, the kids sort through size (big, medium, small), shapes (circle, triangle, square) and then color (grey, black, yellow).  One day we read this and do sensory bins with a shape bin, and a button bin.  One day we glue buttons to a firetruck, or the dots of a dalmatian.  We read it each day again until we move on to the next MathStart book.  Great for PreK.  I think it would be too simplistic for a kinder-gardener however.', '*3 Little Firefighters* has just under 300 words, and it\\'s part of a series purporting to deal with math skills. So you really have to wonder what kind of breathtakingly incompetent editor would allow a number error to make it into such a small book--on p. 11, the text says, \"We\\'ve got to find four sets,\" when in fact, the book is only dealing with three sets. Now, obviously, a parent dealing with a child who can\\'t read yet can correct this mistake himself, but I think the error is indicative of the lack of care and thought that has gone into these books. The rhymes lack creativity, the stories have no charm, and most of the books, including this one, try to teach skills that a child should pick up naturally through daily interaction with an adult. My advice: Skip this one; skip the whole series.And whoever was supposed to edit this book at HarperTrophy should learn how to read.', \"Cute story with the only diverse crew I've seen in a children's book.

I looked at a lot of illustrated bibles for children, and this was the only one I found with multicultural drawings, which was really important to me.

She's even trying to read it by herself now.\", 'With the name \"Beginner\\'s Bible\", I thought it might be a good Bible for my toddler.  It\\'s a little beyond her understanding.  The wording is not age appropriate for her, and the story vs. picture ratio is a little higher than she prefers at 2.That said, I think this is a great Bible for a 4 or 5 year old.  As their attention span grows, their use for this Bible story book will as well.  Although, some things (like death) are not avoided in the stories.  I\\'m not sure this age can fully grasp those concepts, but the parent reading the stories can make that decision for their child during storytime.', 'Great book for young baby.

It arrived promptly and in great condition!', \"I was looking for a book to introduce Christian stories as part of our world mythology unit for young homeschooled kids. I wanted something simple enough to interest even kindergarteners but this is too simple. The adult involved would have to have extensive Christian background in order to discuss the stories with the children because there is so little information there. It may be useful for Christian parents who can flesh out the stories. I was raised Pagan and even I know more of the stories than is in there but I don't know enough to make it a good book for my kids. I give it two stars because the illustrations portray historically correct skin colors, which is rare in illustrated Bible stories and much appreciated in a multi-racial home.

What a wonderful chance to share a close time when we're relaxed with nothing to distract us.  A great introduction to the Bible and a chance to share my faith in a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere.The Beginner's Bible: Timeless Children's Stories\", 'The problem with this beginners Bible is how it represents God. Imagine, the story of Noah begins with God being \"sad\" because people didn\\'t think of him (and so consequently flooding the earth). This makes God seem like a tyrant to a small child (imagine creating fear in a child re: thinking of God). The actual scripture says \"the thoughts of man were only evil all of the time.\" This could be better put into child language such as God felt upset because the people he made kept hurting each other and doing mean things to each other (so SOMETHING closer to the idea in scripture). A kind of lazy thinking dominates both the text and illustrations (which lack any depth or expression besides googley eyes). Imagine my dismay when I received three for my sons first birthday. As someone who does not like to take God\\'s name in vain, I feel this thoughtless representation does just that.', 'I bought this book for a baby shower gift, and I am thrilled with it.  I teach an adult Sunday School class, and find that this is a great little book for children.  It is Biblically accurate and colorfully illustrated.  Great buy.', 'Good book for really young kiddos. I would not recommend it to anyone 6 years or older. Stories are watered down.', 'My 5 year old lets me read this to him nightly, the illustrations are great & readings short enough to not lose his interest.  This is a great way to share the Bible stories with my child.', \"My 2 1/2 year old loves this, she calls it her Bible and she reads it by herself all the time!  The illustrations are great.  The stories are complex enough to really teach, better than another book like this we got where the stories are only 2 pages each.  Sometimes the language is too old for her to understand (otherwise I would have given it 5 stars), and once in a while I'll just kind of paraphrase a whole page, but that's ok, we usually elaborate on the stories anyway to teach her more about God's nature.  Overall though the stories contained in this book do a pretty good job of showing God's nature, and I think it's a perfect overview to the Bible for 2 years old and up.\", 'we got this for our infant daughter and read one story to her every day. i love that the stories are short and pictures are very colorful.', 'This is such a nice Bible - the illustrations are just beautiful and very well done.  My only complaint is that some of the stories leave you hanging the way they\\'re written and don\\'t really go into a little more explanation like they should.  Other than that, we just love this Bible.  My little one really liked the \"snake\" story, as he calls it, meaning Adam and Eve.  Makes for a very long explanation, however, when they ask about who the snake really is and why Adam and Eve got kicked out of the Garden of Eden.  Then, tie all that into why Jesus came and you\\'ve got an all night discussion!  Pretty neat stuff too - if your little one enjoys figuring out where Jesus is in all the stories, point out that He\\'s always the one in purple, the color of royalty.  The crucifixion story is very well done and not made to be all that scary.  Just be ready for tons of questions throughout this whole book.  Highly recommend!', \"This Bible has pictures that tell the Bible stories and it has synopses of the scriptures that go with the pictures.

For example, the story of Jesus selecting his disciples has a picture of all 12 with Judas having a sneaky look in his eyes.  I can't recommend it enough!!!\", \"Our little 3 year old loves this book.  He asks his Daddy to read stories every night and this wonderful.  He is hearing about the Lord in a fun and colorfully illustrated book.  It  doesn't have any scary pictures in it either.  And that is a concern with some of the other toddler Bibles.  They might not think so, but having angry faces and such can be scary for a little one  This book's illustrations are very benign.  There is one minor Scriptural inconsistency that my husband and I found.  It states that Pharaoh was swept away along with his army.  The Bible doesn't state that, just Pharaoh's army.

When the Israelites overrun Jericho it just says that they take over the city. I think the early years are a little too soon to find out that the Jews killed every man, woman, and child (including babies) in the city except the whore Rahab and her family because Rahab had betrayed her fellow Jericho inhabitants to the invaders. Also, if they found out Rahab's house was built on the wall and the wall came tumbling down but she still survived, THAT'S sure as all get out going to confuse kids. It even does me. Good enough for little kids until they get old enough to find out the truth. Update: Gave 7 and 8 year old granddaughters this bible. The 8 year old couldn't put it down. She and her 7 year old cousin hid under a blanket after they were supposed to be asleep and read it with a flashlight until they finished it.\", 'This Bible has been the perfect teaching tool for my child.  The illustrations are vibrant and engaging, the text is appropriate for young readers, and the division of stories comes at the right spacing for brief attention spans.

As well as the read along story there is a play section where the child can interact more with the coloring pages that can be colored right on the iPad. There are also jigsaw puzzles to challenge the young mind. A video game is also included in the first story pack that helps the child with manual dexterity. Each story pack can be purchased right through the app.I am a grandmother so I do not have young children in the household but I think that this app is a must for the family that wants to share God's story with their children.

I gave Karyn's bible to my son seven years ago and was looking for a replacement for my daughter.  I bought this bible by mistake because the illistrations and title were so similar and have been hugely disappointed.  It lacks depth and purpose in the stories.  This book might as well been written by an athiest who can spout out a story line but lacks any genuine understanding behind the story.  If looking for a children's bible I strongly recommend finding a Beginner's Bible by Karen Henley (used or new) rather than settling for this or any other children's edition that reduces these stories to a trite sequence of events.\", 'This is a very kid friendly version of the Bible with keeping the Truth in as well.

The App is great, with the same stories, illustrations and adding audio features with a soothing male and female reading it for early readers and non readers.

There are color pages to use too!The initial pack is free, and additional packs sell for $1.99 with 6 stories, games and puzzles to go along with it, to be able to bring you through the Bible.I loved the print version of the book, used it with my own kids 3 years ago, and have given it to numerous people to use with their children and ministries to kids.

She'll sit and listen to the cd's for quite awhile and of course loves for us to read her the stories too.  I'm planning to put the CD's in the car & keep the Bible in the house.  As for the Bible itself, it has a LOT of stories that are well-written with nice illustrations.\", \"My wife bought this bible, the DeVries version, for our daughter a year or so ago, and it's been a common bedtime-reading resource. For our now-first-grade daughter, it's been a great source of basic bible-story information and a good basic tool for her reading development: we often read the content together, alternating lines or stories, and her sight reading and phonetic deconstruction both have moved ahead with great strides. On the content front, although she's the youngest in the early-elementary class at Sunday school, she's typically among the best informed, including concerning minutiae such as the details of David's early years, his friendship with Jonathan, and the decline and eventual demise of King Saul.So whether it's better or worse than its predecessor, I can't say, but this is pretty good for a first bible, and my daughter loves it, which counts for a lot to me.\", \"When my 7 year old son came to me with questions about God, I confess I did not have many answers for him as I am agnostic and not very religious.  He was so persistent, I bought this bible for him.  He's not much of a reader, but he devoured this book.My 5 year old daughter is also turning out to be quite religious.  She had many questions and my son read this book to her.  They both love it.  The stories are simple and easy enough for a 7 year old to read and understand.  The illustrations are bright and colorful, the type that would captivate a young audience.Since I am not very religious, I do not know enough about the bible to judge the accuracy of the stories or be offended by any variations from it.  I do know that my young son, who never reads unless it`s a school assignment, read every page at least twice.\", 'I got this for my daughter (age 6) when she got baptized. It well done, my daughter enjoys reading it with me. It is well written for the age group. I would recommend it.', \"This is a very inviting book that accomplishes two things together: it familiarizes the kids with names and timeless stories from the Bible and it further encourages young children (ages 3-6) to read independently as every page contains only two to five simple sentences. Colorful pictures and engaging storytelling are the excellent features of the BEGINNER's BIBLE and the major stories in Old Testament (Adam and Eve(from to Joseph's colorful robe, from the Wise King Solomon to Jonah & the Big Fish) as well as New Testament (from Jesus' birth to His teaching on a mountain, from His parables to His miracles, from His fructification to His risen) are all included.

This is what we settled on and the kids love it.  We also now use this as a gift when I perform baby dedications to the families.', 'This is a great collection of bible stories! It uses appropriate language for babies/toddlers with kid friendly pictures.  I\\'m impressed by the way it approaches all aspects of stories including the less happy details without being scarry.  My only disappointment is that it leaves out a little too much detail sometimes (ex: only 3 of the 10 commandments were listed - but they got in \"honor thy father and mother\" :-) ) but that does allow for parents to discuss the teachings with their kids. Over all I\\'m very happy with it and so is my daughter.', 'Bought this bible for my 5-yr-old and she absolutely loves it.  My 2-yr-old enjoys it too.  It makes learning fun.  I recommend it to everyone!', \"It's not as in-depth as i thought it would be and my preschooler is ready for more lengthy stories.  This is a cute book and the CD that reads it to him is nice to have, but I'm going to have to upgrade already.\", \"My kids are 4yo and this was an easy book to understand for them.  There are pictures on each page so they often flip the pages and say they are reading their Bible.  I was concerned that the subject matter would be difficult, but this book still reviews the areas of the Bible without so much detail that they lose interest. There are no graphic images of Jesus's death (picture of Mary holding feet at cross not rest of body). They ask for a specific story and bring this book to Bible class along with other kids.  I often see the characters in their class for discussion, so the images are familiar.  I think if they were older the images would be too cartoonish, but for now, it is an interesting book for them.  To note it is a large book-511 pages- for their size (may be heavy for younger age), but they enjoy holding it and the importance of the size.\", \"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 7-year-old daughter. She'd been begging for a bible of her own & after reading the reviews & seeing the recommended age of 4-8 I thought it would be great for her.  I was a bit disappointed when the book came & I saw right on the back cover that it states: Ages 2-5.The reading is o.k. for her age but the illustrations would be best for the younger age group as suggested by the publisher.  Nevertheless the stories are still great & it's a nice book.  My 5-year-old son will enjoy this a bit more though than the 7-year-old.I would recommend this book but to the ages 2-5 rather than 4-8.\", \"I bought this book for my Goddaughter (almost 4 years old), but ended up reading quite a bit of it myself (haha!). It's a great refresher for adults. :) I was deciding between this and another children's bible and went with this one because of its &#34;toned down&#34; versions of some of the more graphically violent Bible stories. While it does mention killing, it doesn't dwell or focus on it or go into graphic detail about it. I felt (somewhat) comfortable reading it my son. You can't really get around the fact that quite a bit of mayhem goes on in the Bible, but this gives a context for parents to address it with their children. If you're concerned, just preview the story before you read it. Many are &#34;safe.&#34; It's fast and easy to do that because the stories are only about 5 pages (they take about 90 seconds to read).\", 'Nice hardcover and fun pictures. Simple stories that are easy to read for children. My sister reads from this to her children. Nicely written...', \"I like the book and think it's a nice introduction to these bible stories. So many of the top reviews here decry the publisher's release of an edition absent Karen Henley's illustrations. Neither of these factors are an issue for me. I like prefer the new illustrations.\", 'This is a great way to introduce your children to the Bible. My daughter really enjoys us reading it to her. The Chapter and verse is listed with each story so you can look up stories that you wish to share with your children. The subjects are presented in a short enough length so as not to lose the attention span of your child. They also make great bedtime stories because you can choose how much to read each night.I especially liked the way that this book handled diffucult topics like the crucifixion of Jesus. It does not shy away from these topics, but presents them in an understandable format. I would highly recommend purchasing.']\n",

Bright colors, cute book!', 'My baby loves the flaps!! We read this book over and over again', 'My 16 month old daughter is not overly excited by most books and loses intrest quickly, but she loves this book and can play with it for an hour. She loves to bring it to us to read with her, and she loves lifting the flaps and she giggles at her accomlishment of showing us where \"baby\\'s belly button/eyes/hands etc\" are.I would recommend this book because its great for interaction between your child and you, the illistrations are colorful and cute, and it helps toddlers learn different body parts.', 'My son LOVES this book.  The flaps are sturdy and easy for him to pull by himself. And he loves pointing to the baby\\'s body part and then to his own (and whoever else is around).  As soon as we reach the end of the story he says \"AGAIN\".

Sent it as a Christmas gift.', \"I recently bought this book for my new born niece. She is now five months old. When I read her the book, she smiles and has this face of amazement on her. She stares at the bright colors and even tries to hold my hand when I flip the flaps over.While I'm reading her the book, I point to her (my niece) body parts that coincide with the book so she learns in many ways.This book is great as a starter and is ideal for babies and toddlers which is a fun teaching tool for the human anatomy.I would recommend this book to any new mother-to-be and/or parents of babies/toddlers!!!

Available on Amazon.', \"My 18-month-old is good at sitting through books, and she does sometimes like this book but it definitely isn't an every day reader.  She doesn't seem to be too excited with lifting the flaps, which is strange because she likes to on other books.  I do think the illustrations are pretty sweet though.\", \"These two books - Where Is Baby's Belly Button and Toes, Ears, and Nose are so similar, you only need one of them. And my boys prefer Toes, Ears, and Nose. I'm not sure why, but maybe it's because more body parts are discussed.\", \"My son loves this book. He is very into belly buttons, which is why I  bought this book for him. The book goes through several different parts (i.e. eyes, toes) and isn't just about belly buttons. My son is also a big fan of the lift-the-flap books. He will often laugh out loud like he's playing peek-a-boo with the book. The flaps on our copy haven't fared so well. In his excitement, my son his ripped a few of the flaps off of the page. They are made out of a lighter-weight material (it feels like a thin cardboard) than the sturdier pages are made of, but my son loves this book so much that I will be ordering another copy of it for him.\", \"My son loves Karen Katz's flap books.  He loves the interaction and the illustrations.  The only thing I find weird is that on the page when you finding a belly button, you are lifting up another kid's shirt; still, the only body parts shown under the shirt is the belly button.\", 'My daughter has never been interested in this book.  She\\'s 21 months old, and we\\'ve had it for over a year, but it never seemed to hold her attention.  Therefore, I can only give it three stars!  She does, however, enjoy the very similar \"Daddy and Me\"!  Go figure!', 'Where Is Baby\\'s Belly Button? is one of my daughter\\'s favorites. At first, I read it to her and lifted the flaps, but now she lifts the flaps as I read it to her. Many times I\\'ve had to read this book three times in a row!The flaps on this book are more durable than some. They\\'ve become bent from much use but are still hanging on. Baby has ripped off lesser flaps.After reading this book to my baby for months, I recently caught my 10 month old flipping through the pages on her own saying \"baby\" as she lifted the flaps. I read one of the pages to her  as she sat there and she immediately climbed into my lap to have the book finished.', 'I love this book for my grand girl Kate.  This is a hard, flip cover book which is great for my one year old grand girl.', 'This is a simple lift the flap book but I love it because the flaps are nice and big and my daughter really likes the illustrations of the cute babies. My older child loved this book so much that some of the flaps tore off so I am here to buy another. Highly recommend!', 'I bought this for my granddaughter and she already has it, so it stays at my house.  It is her favorite book.  She can re-read this one over and over.  She is 18 months old.', 'I bought this book based on rave reviews and recommendation for my daughter. While it\\'s a great concept and the colors are eye catching, the book was a real flop for my daughter and I because the flaps were so hard to open. My daughter would lose interest between \"Where is Baby\\'s mouth?\" and the time it would take for me to reveal the body part. When she was older, she also had trouble opening them, and we had to bend a few flaps to make it easier. I really try to avoid this book during story time.', \"I enjoy Karen Katz' illustrations, we have 3 of her books, and my toddler has been taken with this one in particular ever since we got it.  We tried to read it with her only when supervised, but still we have lost a few flaps which must be glued back in place.  Lift-the-flaps are so enticing for little ones, I wish they made them more durable.\", \"My daughter (1 year old) loves this book! The flaps are pretty sturdy and she loves finding the baby's body parts. It has provided hours of fun and is a great night time book. Highly recommended!!!\", 'This is a cardboard book so very good starter book.  There are tabs inside for the child to lift up.', \"My 17 month old son sped through this, learned his body parts and didn't have much use for it after. Very cute though!\", 'My 18 mos old granddaughter loves this book. She lifts the flaps and then points to those body parts on her own self.', 'My nine month old baby girl loves this book.  Such a fun and simple book to read along and identify common body parts.', 'Purchased for my 1 year old grandson, and he loves to lift the flaps while his parents read to him', \"I liked this book because it teaches other body parts as well (such as hands and feet). It is great for teaching prepositions such as under, behind, etc. Don't let your child have it independently if they tear paper or tags out of books.\", \"This is a great book, I purchased this book when my daughter was 18 months and it's one of her favorite books (she has 3 favorite books).  She will pull the book from her book box and I will read it over and over again.  She knows where all her hands, mouth, eyes, hands, feet and belly button are.  It's a great book!\", \"I bought countless books before my baby was born, including most of  the classics, and from about 6 months on, tried to get him interested in any and all of them with no success.  Eventually between 7-9 months, after reading the reviews here, I ordered this. And voila! He seemed to like it -- well, he would at least sit still on my lap long enough to turn the pages and lift the flaps!  Three months later, it is definitely his favorite book -- he giggles when I pull it out, and loves to lift the flaps up and down, and up and down, and up and down.  After three months of all that upping and downing the flaps ARE raggedy and curled up, but he doesn't seem to mind. I figure on buying it again when it really gets worn.  I would definitely recommend this if you are trying to get a younger, active baby interested in books.\", 'I highly recommend this book for anyone who is raising children and are learning about body parts.Very cute read.', 'I like this book because it can be read by mother or parent ,grandparent or young child to baby and then when baby is a little older it becomes an interactive experience as baby learns to lif the flap and even later to identify in worsds the object.', \"This is a nice sturdy book with colorful drawings of babies with some part of their body hidden.  Each page asks, &quot;Where is baby's ...?&quot;  Toddlers delight in lifting the flaps to find the hidden pictures.  The pictures are bright and cute with eye-catching fabric and wallpaper patterns.  A very attractive book, and perfect for that stage when toddlers become fascinated with their belly buttons!  My 17 month old has really enjoyed this book.  It can be very helpful in getting kids to name body parts, and it's fun for both the baby and the parents to read.  Highly recommended.\", \"lift-the-flap books are generally a huge hit with my 21-month old and this book is among his favourites ('Where is Spot?' being his absolute favourite). He loves pointing out his own belly button, eyes, ears, etc. and playing peekaboo alongside the babies in the book.Fun and educational ... can't go far wrong with this book!\", \"There are a lot of positives about this book. It teaches your child to look for something, and you can also teach your little one about eyes and feet..etc. The colors are very attractive and draw your attention to the page. The cover is sturdy, the flaps however are the only downside. Just be aware that they are easily bended or torn.While I love this book and don't regret purchasing it, I do wish that they publisher could see that children are not friendly to books at a young age, and having a little sturdier flap would prevent tearing and having to purchase additional copies of this book.\", 'My grandson loved this book. He learned where his belly button was with it. He always picked this out of all of his books to read first. I think kids love lift a flap books anyway.', \"All babies and kids love this book! We've collected the whole &#34;Where is Baby's.....&#34; book series. It never gets old with a toddler.\", \"I love that I can read through this book and teach my son where his mouth, feet, etc. are as we read.  However, the flaps are simply attached to the pages, rather than inverted into the pages, and are SUPER easy to rip off.  Sadly, this book vs. a toddler just isn't a fair fight!\", \"We don't live in the same town, so I'm not sure about this book. He seemed to like it when I gave it to him, but now he is walking and playing with other toys. Still loves books and like most children he has his favorites.\", \"This book has been a favorite of my daughter's from about 12 months to now, when she is 18 months. She really enjoys turning the flaps and finding the items and then showing where the items (belly button etc.) are located on herself, her teddy bear, etc. Good value for money. She sometimes tear off a flap, and that is the only reason I do not give this item 5 stars, but the flaps are pretty easy to tape on again. This book is better than some other lift-the-flap books where it is hard for the infant to see where the flap is.\", \"We got this for my baby at around 6 months and she loved it then but constantly wanted to eat the flaps. This is not a board book so we didn't pull it out for her much until around 8 months when she stopped teething on the flaps.  Even at about 8 months she was really good at lifting the flaps herself and now at 10 months she is starting to associate the body parts in the book with her body parts.  We always touch her foot, hand, etc when we find that part in the book.  The other day she lifted her own shirt to find her belly button which was cute but also shows us that she is learning.  We used clear packaging tape to mend a tear from an excited baby lifting a flap too hard and it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to do that to all of the flaps to make this book last.\", \"My little one loves it. I read the page and then ask, &#34;Where are YOUR feet?&#34; It's a great learning/response book with &#34;lift the flap&#34; illustrations. Highly recommended.\", \"We are on child #2 with this book and both of my kids have requested it over and over and over and over. My youngest, 19 months, is 'reading' it to us. I found my 5 yr old reading it to the youngest one last night.It is easy to understand, fun for the babies and easily read by my other kid. What could be better? Well, maybe a space age polymer that keeps the flaps on when an overzealous toddler continues to try and wrestle them off.\", 'I think this book is cute, it allows my son to think about what I am reading to him.  He lifts all the flaps himself to find the items in question.', 'This is a great book for infants and toddlers. They love lifting the flaps and learning the parts of the body.', 'I really love every Karen Katz book I have ever seen. This one is especially cute. My two-year-old loves lifting flaps. Frankly, my four-year-old also still enjoys this book. The artwork is terrific, and the colors are vibrant. A total winner of a board book!', 'This is a WONDERFUL book.  It satisfies my daughter\\'s great love for peek a boo and naming and searching for different body parts.  No matter how many times we read this book, she always acts \"surprised\" to see what is underneath the flap and finds great fun in searching for her own belly button or hands (or whatever the page says).  The flaps are sturdy and have withstood my \"toddler\\'s terror\" even after reading this book over...and over...and over...  You and your little one will love this one.', \"Although this was fun while it lasted, I can't help but feel there was a lack of any real challenge in this book. You can see it on the front cover for Pete's sake! Stick to Where's Waldo.\", \"I gave this to my 1-year-old granddaughter.  She was not interested at all.  She kept trying to find something to press or squeeze to make noise, and when she couldn't, she gave it up.\", 'My husband babysits for our granddaughter a couple of hours a day and she is always busy.  This book catches the interest of a 9-month old and gives her something do do while they read!', 'This is a very cute book. My one year old loves to lift the flaps to find the hidden picture. The only problem is the flaps bend way too easily so they no longer lay flat after only a few weeks of use. He also tore out an entire flap in his excitement of opening it. This is definately a read with supervision book and I wish there was a way they could have made the flaps less destructible.', \"Purchased this for our baby, he's now 8 months old.  He loves the pictures and is happy to help me turn the pages.  He gets a kick out of the flip up flaps but I have to be sure to take the book away from him when I'm not reading it to him because he has started to try to tear and eat the flip up pages.  For the danger of the tearing and eating pieces of the flaps, I gave it 4 stars.\", 'This book is one of my children\\'s favoirte books.  They loved pulling down the flaps and seeing what was hidden.  It is also a fun way for them to learn their body parts.  A fun way to learn terms and concepts like \"behind\" and \"underneath\".  My children wanted to read it over and over again.', 'I think this was one of the favorite books for both of our kids when we started to read to them.  Highly recommended.', 'A fun education book for a little one learning their body parts. Very fun for little ones to lift the flaps and learn where their body parts are.

Cute in board book form with the interactive flaps.', 'I bought this book because it was a flip book and it allows my son to know some of his body parts.

This book plays on this fascination and is fun for infants and toddlers.', 'My 8 months old absolutely loves this book. He laughs every time he uncovers the flap. The only negative, the flaps are pretty weak for a baby grip. We already had to reattach several pages.

Still my baby liked it so i give it 4 stars\", \"I got his for my daughter when she was abotu 20 months, and learning body parts.  She learned to say many new parts that I thought she wouldn't be able to do, like Back and Elbow.  She loves the lift the flapping, but some of the flaps are abnormal shaped, and can get ripped easily.\", 'My daughter, who is 2, completely loves this book and thoroughly enjoys the surprise of each page and finding the \"hidden\" body part.', 'This is the sort of book that will let you tickly baby and do a lot of cuddling as you read.

They're the first books she's been able to &#34;read&#34; on her own as they have simple language.  And the books have helped her to learn her body parts as they're pointed out on each page.  I have bought these books for friends children too as they are such a hit in my house.

(Simon and Schuster, 2000)A lift-the-flaps book Karen Katz-style, with her distinctive illustrations and simple text. It's a lovely book, but it's getting a slightly lower review than I'd otherwise give it because it's not as well-constructed as it would be reasonable to expect given that much of the flap-lifting is going to be done by the pre-lit set; the flap on the back page, especially, is likely to start coming loose after just weeks of handling (it covers almost the entire page) . Still, that shouldn't dissuade you from getting a copy (though you may want to pick it up from the library first to give it a test). ***\", 'I bought this for my 3 year old daughter.

She squeals with delight as soon as I pick it up because she knows what\\'s coming. I read Katz\\'s Counting Kisses to her every night and we also have Daddy Hugs. The illustrations in those two are also engaging. But nothing delights her as much as the lift the flap aspect of this book.It\\'s especially intriguing how she \"reads\" the last lift a flap. I point out the bear, ball, and wagon and I say \"but where\\'s baby, where could he be?\" Then I lift the flap to reveal the baby, my daughter squeals, claps and smiles big and then thoughtfully looks back over at the bear, ball and wagon and then back at the revealed baby. It\\'s like she knows the entire scene has changed by the revealing of the baby. How can a parent not love a book that elicits such engaged thoughtful behavior?I\\'d recommend it highly for babies from the peekaboo stage to the learning body parts stage.', \"I bought this book for my daughter who was just a little over 1 at the time. She was able to learn her body parts by pointing after she would lift the flap in the book.  It was so neat to see. Now at age 2 she'll still grab this book off the shelf and want to point out body parts of her dolls, our dogs, and even us!  I recommend this book for any young toddler ages 1-2!  It's perfect!\", 'Here\\'s a nice peekaboo book for parent (or grandparent) and child. The pages are large, as are the flaps making them easier to flip than those in a smaller book. In the book are pictures of babies with large faces, great for the young \"reader\".

Nice, interactive, educational book.', 'I bought this book for my son last Christmas when he was 8 months old.  He was thrilled as he lifted each of the flaps to find what was inside.  It taught him to name some of his body parts espcially his belly button.  Even at 20 months he will still bring this book to me or sit alone and read it. I loved the illustrations and even drew reference to it to calm him when he  took his first bubble bath.', \"Not for children who can't handle books properly.

I have no idea why this book tickles him so much, but anything that keeps him happy an laughing is a permanent hit with me.

The illustrations are colorful and simple, which is very engaging for a 12-18 month old. I also love the focus on learning spatial relations (behind, under, etc.), and the great fine-motor skill practice that comes from lifting these oversized flaps. The flaps are as sturdy as most, but they will eventually separate from the book, o keep your wide scotch tape handy!\", \"A great little lift-the-flap book. The words are so simple, perfect for babies. My baby started lifting flaps around 11 months and this book was right up his alley. He read it every night. He loved to flip all the flaps and then touch the face of the baby hiding behind the flap, and when he got to the last page, he would always smile when he found the hiding baby.

Definitely need to beware of this issue while reading to her. The only reason I gave this book a four is it doesn't teach my daughter much at all compared to her other book &#34;Toes, Ears and Nose&#34;! That book truly helped my daughter learn all of her body parts and is a fun, interactive way to keep practicing identifying them.\", 'Me and my daughter, who\\'s 19 months old now, both love this book.

It's a synopsis of the movie from Dash's perspective (funny how they can condense a movie into that small of a book!), but it makes it quite fun for the little ones just learning to read.  Really like this book in our house - took back a creepy Spiderman book for this one, which NEVER happens!  Highly Recommend!\", 'My (almost) 5 year old son LOVES superheroes!  He loves to watch the movie \"The Incredibles\" over and over...  Dash is his favorite character.  He will be so happy to receive this book for Christmas!', \"My 3 1/2 year old loves The Incredibles, especially Dash! It's hard to find many Incredibles books and we love the step into reading books so this was perfect. We got it for this Christmas and I'm sure he will love it. It is a level 3 with a lot words, but he has been sitting still for longer stories. He also checked out a couple chapter books from the library recently (not quite ready for them) and there are less words and more pictures in this book so I think this will be great. I'm so excited for him to get it!\", \"This is a short book that tells the story of the movie 'The Incredibles' from Dash's point of view.  The writing uses easy words and simple sentences for kids, and if you're familiar with the movie (we are) then it's a great companion.  Note that if you don't already know the movie the story may not make a whole lot of sense.  Overall we love this book (and the movie).\", \"With THE INCREDIBLES movie being such a hit and since the film is distributed by Disney, there's bound to be some supermarketing going on. THE INCREDIBLE DASH is one such item that ties into the Mouse's marketing campaign. The book is supposedly told from the viewpoint of Dash, the middle child in the Parr (or Incredible) family. Basically, the book explains in very easy to understand language the story told in the movie. The book is labeled as a &#34;Step 3&#34; step into reading book, but shouldn't be difficult to handle at all for any child half way through the first grade. The hardest words to read are the names of some of the characters, such as Omnidroid and Syndrome. There really isn't anything to set the book apart from any other books of its type, but since it is a tie-in to THE INCREDIBLES it might encourage reluctant-reading younger children to pick up a book and read. The least incredible of THE INCREDIBLES merchandise that I have seen or read thus far.\"]\n",

I\\'ll never claim to make anything like The Nancy or my personal fave Edwardo\\'s, but it isn\\'t half bad.Not sure about the tomato paste, though. Are we reading the same recipe? Canned tomatoes, chopped by hand (I use a pastry knife), all the way.I echo the review that said you have to bake the crust a bit first to keep it from getting soggy. I\\'ve also done a bit of experimenting along the way, and think the sauce I have come up with improves on the one in the book, but any good cook should be willing to do that, I\\'d think. Tastes differ and all that.Anyway this book has helped me keep my pizza sanity 1700 miles west of Mecca. Highly recommended.', 'Thought I would make more Classic Italian Pizza than I do. This will give you all of the basics and more.', 'I am from Chicago and previously owned a different Chicago-Style Pizza Cookbook that was much better.  While the author gives good advise about exactly how to make many styles of crusts and pizzas and gives a few recipes for each of the many styles, and the book has many pictures, some of which are useful, he only has one recipe for stuffed pizza (the most popular style in Chicago for years and the style which is known across the world as &#34;Chicago Style&#34;) which is an old, out of date recipe, yielding substandard results when you follow it exactly.  The book was published almost 20 years ago and it shows.  Pizza keeps evolving, and this book is out of date regarding true Chicago-Style Pizza.', 'This book has a lot of good pizza info in it. Good recipes and tips for making the best pizza and sauces.', 'This is actually a great \"springboard\" book for creating pizza. Many of the recipes are delicious. As far as Chicago deep dish pizza is concerned though, the book doesn\\'t deliver a \"Lou Malnatis\" or \"Giordanos\" quality pizza. Still it is a worthwhile starting point to develop your own. I would purchase it as a gift for someone who is looking to get the basics.', \"First of all, NO, these are not the secret recipes of Giordano's, Gino's, Pizzeria Uno, or the others.They are, however, very good pizza recipes. My main criticism of the book is that some of the instructions are incomplete. For example, in the stuffed pizza recipe he tells you to put the sauce on top of the pizza without pre-cooking the pizza at all. In my experience, that always results in a doughy, partially-uncooked top crust. I prebake the pizza with no sauce for about 10 minutes, then add the sauce, and it's great. But Bruno should've told me that; I shouldn't have had to figure it out for myself.Yes, I would like to get my hands on the actual Giordano's recipe, but these recipes still beat any pizza I can get here in Oregon.\", \"love love this book an just can't wait till i bake my first deep dish pizza, soon i will be enjoying one!\", 'A very basic guide to making pizza. There are certainly no secrets shared here. Approximately two recipes per style of pizza are included in the book.

BOOKCASE\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tBill Watterson is the creator of Calvin and Hobbes, one of the most popular and well-regarded cartoon strips of the twentieth century. Calvin and Hobbes appeared in newspapers from November 1985 until Watterson's retirement in 1996.Online:gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/\", 'Pros:Funny, Hilarious, Clever, Beloved, TimelessCons:noneBest Uses:Antidote to the gloomies, Read aloud, Pick me up, Sharing, Read at the tableBottom Line:Yes, I would recommend this to a friendMy son is 8 years old. He loves Calvin and Hobbes. It has humor for him, and for us - his parents. It also gives us an opportunity to teach him advanced words when desired.I loved Calvin and Hobbes when it first came out. Now I get to love it all over again through the eyes of my son as we all read it together.', \"I suppose this could apply to any Calvin and Hobbes collection (not just Attack of the Deranged..., but let me share my favorite way to read Calvin and Hobbes.If possible, I like to pick a rainy Saturday or Sunday.  I'm usually already bored and wandering around the cold house.  I catch sight of a Calvin and Hobbes book and read a few pages, but my fingers are cold and I can't concentrate.So I make a steaming cup of my favorite tea and a piece of toast with lots of butter, wrap up in a blanket on the couch, and sit and read straight through.It's so comforting to listen to the rain and read Calvin and Hobbes.  There's just something about it.Er, see other reviews for information about this actual book.\", \"Purchased this for my nephew along with Avatar: The Last Airbender and Ultimate Spiderman. His hands-down favorite was Calvin & Hobbes. Of course they're classic, the dialog is witty and there's loads of subtext but it really surprised me that over all the big action and superpowers, he was most interested in the warmth that comes from an imaginary stuffed tiger.\", 'We were under the impression this was going to contain 100% snowman illustrations, so were slightly disappointed upon seeing that that was clearly not the case.But Calvin is a great cartoon and helps engage a parent and child in conversation and having a good laugh together...', \"How can anyone not like Calvin in spite of his mischief. This is one good funny book packed with Calvin & Hobbes comic strips. Oh... there's a lot beyond the snow goons. Susie appears quite frequently in spite of Calvin (and Hobbes) efforts to thwart her. If you like C&H, you'll want this book. I've read it and reread it over the years and never tire of Calvin's adventures! I wonder how Calvin's mom keeps from getting gray hair?\", 'I love this comic, and I think Watterson is genius. Calvin is one messed up kid and his adventures with his stuffed tiger hobbes are hillarious, and  sometimes quite strange. I love it when  they take pictures and Calvin keeps making faces, just like my little brother used to. This is such a good comic and I can not wait to own more of them.', \"All Calvin and Hobbes books are great.  But this one, in which Calvin imagines that he has brought a demonic snowman to life, may be the best of  the bunch.  The sequence of strips in which Calvin is sure that the snowman  and his friends are out to kill him may be the most brilliant of Bill  Watterson's career.  He is an absolute comic genius whose presence in the  funny pages has been sorely missed since his retirement.  &quot;Snow  Goons&quot; is Watterson at his finest.\", \"If you want inspiration for winter time fun then this is the book for you. WIth Calvin's help you can build a village of snow goons!\", 'I\\'ve always loved the intense imagination of the cartoonist for Calvin and Hobbes and was quite thrilled when Santa brought this book this Christmas for my 8-year-old. Well, to say they\\'re loved immensely by not only him, but the rest of the neighborhood, classroom, etc., would be a sincere understatement.  If something can transcend generations, it has to be good and this book and overall collection of Calvin is no exception. I\\'ve missed reading these greatly but also have wondered why Bill hasn\\'t taken up writing novels.  Can you imagine how \"far-out\" they would be with his imagination?! Sure would like to see him take a crack at that!  Anyway, be SURE to grab this one in particular if you have a bunch of ornery boys running around.  They go bonkers over those snow goons and I even heard, \"this is WAY better than Diary of a Wimpy Kid!\"  That definitely says it all - especially if you\\'re as tired of \"potty humor\" as I am! Highly, highly, highly recommend!', 'I know that not a lot of people would want to raise a kid like Calvin, but one can\\'t help but love his imaginary adventures. Here, Calvin has accidentally created a \"Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goon\". The ghastly snowman creates snow goons of his own, and now Calvin and Hobbes have to defeat them before they destroy the entire city!Also included here in this seventh installment of the series is a duplicate of Calvin that is the exact opposite of the six-year old troublemaker. He clean his room, does his homework, enjoys his bath, and even has a crush on Susie! Is that what Calvin REALLY wants??I won\\'t go into further details, but I will say that this is one of the finest comics ever created. It won\\'t be forgotten, that\\'s for sure.', \"I've been teaching my son to read English through Calvin and Hobbes books.  I've been surprised how much of it is written with an adult in mind.  We have drawn much amusement from these books.  The Snow Goons isn't quite as rewarding as other C&H collections, but is enjoyable nonetheless.  This is more a weekly format with black and white strip cartoons.  None of the Sunday spreads are contained within this collection, where one really saw Watterson show off his stunning imagination.  However, it is very much worth adding to the archives, especially for bedtime stories.\", 'Calvin & Hobbes... Very witty, entertaining look into the mind of a young, selfish, philosophizing brat... um, boy. (And the funny, often balancing conversations he has with his stuffed tiger & parents!) So honest, and realistic that we can all relate. Even though we may not have said or done the same things this bold lad has! (Thankfully!!) I have a young son who loves these books. Got one for him for his birthday, and another for Christmas. He never tires of them, and the rest of us sneak the book to read too!', 'As a teen, I looked forward to reading the Calvin and Hobbes strip every week. It was my favorite.  As an adult, I happen to have a child who very much reminded me of the Calvin charater; a mischivous, creative, opinionated little boy with a head full of cow-licks, whose \"best friend\" is a stuffed frog.When I thought he was old enough to appreciate the C&H; cartoons, I bought him this book and we have thoroughly enjoyed them together. I will definately be buying more of Watterson\\'s books.', \"I first began reading Calvin and Hobbes in the newspaper around the time he introduced the Killer Snow Goons story, where Calvin builds yet another mutant, deranged snowman--but unlike previous strips, Calvin attempts to bring the snow goon to life a la Frankenstein, leading to the monster creating an army of similarly deranged snow goons.Watterson's artwork as usual is imaginative and humorous, and Calvin and Hobbes' interaction in this book are particularly hilarious.  If you've never read C&H; before, consider this book a great place to start; long-read fans will also enjoy it as one of the best selections in the Calvin & Hobbes library.\", 'It pleases me that my 12 year old grandson appreciates Calvin and Hobbes as much as I do. Bill Watterson is a gifted author.', \"My almost eight year old grandson, who is not an avid reader,  loves the Calvin and Hobbes books.  His older sister knew that this would be a wonderful Christmas gift and she was right.  His parents approved enthusiastically.  Great choice for a school ager who's been so so about reading.!!\", \"I love Calvin and Hobbes. The artwork is great, and the dialogue is funny, thoughtful, and entertaining at the same time. I've been a fan of this comic since 2006.\", \"I've got almost every Calvin and Hobbes collection, but as this was the first one I ever bought I'm going to review it.  What can I say?  What can anyone say?  Bill Watterson has broken the mould of comic strips--this is  the wittiest, silliest, sickest, and most heart-warming fiction I've ever  come across, in ANY medium.  I love his characters, and I love his insane  plotlines--yet there's always a golden nugget of truth at the heart of  each.  Along with Gary Larson, Bill Watterson has breathed new life into  the comic strip genre (and I'm no big fan of comics).  Brilliant,  brilliant, brilliant stuff.\", 'C&H; are timeless. been reading since a kid and hope to pass on to my kids all the fun and memories.better than the collectors edition as it is hard to ask a young kid to put that on their lap during bedtime. this is light and easy to carry like all the originals were.i especially love the snow books. they are my favorite during the winter time.', 'Each book is in the moment the artist has drawn us into. Each piece is very good, never, I already read that a few times. It is enjoyable with the author poking fun at himself and spouse.', 'He absolutely loves this!! Got all the books for his birthday! So surprised when he got it because he always wanted this one!', 'I have loved Calvin and Hobbes for as long as I can remember, and this book is one of the very best of them all.  The highlight of this book is a series wherein Calvin inadvertantly brings a snowman to life, and the snowman turns out to be evil.  Calvin and Hobbes soon have a snowman out to kill them, and when the snowman gives himself an extra head, not to mention an extra arm, Calvin announces \"He\\'s turned himself into a deranged mutant killer monster snow goon!!\", hence the title of the book.  Eventually the snow goon goes off to make an army of snow goons, and Calvin and Hobbes try to come up with a plan to kill them.  Of course, Calvin\\'s parents don\\'t take Calvin seriously, as per usual, so the plan goes awry.I won\\'t give away any more than that, except to say this: the strip where Calvin and Hobbes sneak out in the middle of the night, to carry out Calvin\\'s plan, is HILARIOUS.  This book is worth every penny.', \"I can't say enough about the Calvin and Hobbes collection.  I have been a fan for so many years and will be for the rest of my life!\", \"Bar none, the deranged mutant killer snow goons are my favorite of all of Calvin's imaginary nemeses. The artwork and story lines are the best continuous comics that the very badly-missed Bill Watterson created. The snow goons arise and the battles begin. And, once again, who bears the brunt of this war? Calvin's parents who can't help but wonder how their son turned out the way he did. This is a wonderful collection that I turn to whenever I feel like a six year old besieged by the mutant killer snow goons in the world.\", 'Calvin and Hobbes... you gotta love them!\"I\\'d like to shake the hand of the genius who invented these.\" - Calvin as he lovingly displays a perfect water balloon.\"Our class voted Calvin the \\'Most likely to be seen on the news some day\\'.\" - Susie Derkins, the real expert on Calvin, after Calvin confesses to her that he is hiding from his homicidal bicycle.\"I dunno, it seems like once people grow up, they have no idea what\\'s cool.\" - Calvin after his mom refused his request to get contact lenses... one blood red, and the other \"Yellow striped, like a bug.\"Oh... and why DO adults forget what is cool?', 'My children love reading Calvin and Hobbes and we got this book to add to our collection. They enjoy reading it and the title makes us all smile.', \"Seriously, this is just one more amazing book in a series that NEVER loses its freshness, inventiveness, or sparky, lively graphics; this is, to my mind, the finest accomplishment in the history of graphic novels, a multi-volume set of fireworks that stretched over years of regular contributions that naturally involved a deadline, since the comics originally appeared in newspapers.  At one point I wished that the artist had not stopped; now, with hindsight, I can see that he didn't want to see any decline in the quality of his humor, insight, fantasy, and art.  And he didn't!\", \"I loved Calvin and Hobbes when i was a little kid and I still do now! They're hillarious and Calvin reminds me so much of myself athis age (not in every aspect). Especially our family camp trips. calvin and his mom remind me so much of myself and my mom whenour dad took us camping and it turned out to be a disaster, lol. These cartoons make me want to be a kid again. Almost everyone hassaid this but I'll say it again. You'll start out planning to read a few pages but you won't stop there. you can't. it's so additive. some ofthe younger kids might not understand some of the big words but older kids will. But I think that grownups will enjoy them the most.Get themall!\", \"Look,,,there's no two ways about it...Calvin & Hobbes is the best comic strip ever!  Period!  End of story!  It was a dark and sad day when Creator Bill Watterson ended the strip, but fortunately, the strip lives on through the continued collection of the strips into these wonderful books.Attack Of The Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons is as good as it comes with all of the charm, sarcasm, and bust-a-gut hillarity you've come to expect from this mis-matched pair of friends.I've always enjoyed Calvins Christmas and winter strips the best so this collection is one of my favorites.  I continue to read it over and over again.\", 'I found a discounted copy of this book and put it out in my classroom.  It\\'s already dog-eared.  The kids absolutely love it, and I read it and found myself laughing out loud, even more than usual when I read the strip.Something about Clavin\\'s frenetic, yet philosophical underachieving braininess, the tiger \"Hobbes\" as the best \"straight man\" and sometime-comic foil created in years, and the long-suffering cast of supporting characters speak to everyone\\'s best and fondest memories of childhood when the world was a plaything of the imagination.Recommended!']\n",

It flows wonderfully read out loud. I have adapted the story using animal props and puppets. The kids love it. It is a great book to begin teaching science concepts such as the food chains and habitats. It makes a great addition to theme related activities involving frogs / pond life. If I have to have only one book with me at circle time this one is the one I know will grab the childrens' attention and hold it for multiple readings. A wonderful gift and a must own for every parent and/or teacher.\", 'This book is actually a lot of fun to read. The pictures are bright & beautiful. The icky, sticky tongue on the cover is fun to play with as well. Just a fun book to read!', \"Oh my what a book!  I saw this at babies r us and didn't even think about it - just picked it up and bought it.  It is just the neatest thing - I LOVE that sticky tongue on the front of the book.  We really like frogs in our family and this one really is awesome.  Cute story - teaches about the food chain which is interesting.  My son just loves this book - pulling the tongue and hearing it snap is just a recipe for giggles!  Just a really, really cute idea and well thought out.  Thanks a bunch to the author and publisher.  It's just one of those very unique items that you just have to have, and then buy for everyone else on your list!  Love it!\", 'The Preschool children love the icky sticky tongue on this book.  Another great way to keep their attention during story time.', \"Um.  Wow.  The frog is completely anthropomorphized, as are the bugs he eats.  Then he gets eaten.  I guess you could argue the book teaches about the food chain, but this book just made my 4 year old really sad.  I bought it in a boxed set with 3 other super sweet books.  This one was wrapped in plastic because of the sticky tongue and I didn't bother to read it ahead of time.  A bit of a shocker ending!  Don't order it!\", \"I bought The Icky Sticky Frog for my 3 year old grand-daughter, but after receiving it, I'll donate it to Goodwill.  The problem is that the insects the frog eats, are drawn beautifully and engagingly, and it is just horrible and awful to watch these compelling creatures being murdered one by one.  The fact that the frog gets murdered at the end just teaches a kind of evil vengeance that is hardly a lesson a young child needs.  This is NOT a young child's book.\", \"Yikes! Not many children's picture books end with the main character's demise. Sensitive young kiddos, the intended audience, may be upset by this shocking ending, like my granddaughter was. The novelty is the sticky tongue on the cover...looks cute and may teach the food chain, but I'd pass on this one.\", 'Great book. Kids love the frog tongue. Some people are upset the frog and flies die. This is a natural thing and the kids I read it with understand that.', 'I have been teaching kindergarten for the past 5 years and pre k for 3 years before that and I LOVE THIS BOOK!  First of all I love to sing it suspensefully, shockingly, jauntily.  Add to the fact that it lends itself to retelling, sequencing, making inferences and predictions and all with a wonderful story that can build connections to science concepts and its great for making a flow map I have gone through over a dozen copies as my students quickly grow to love this story so much they beg for it to be in the library  I ws so upset that my brand new copy from last year had disappeared that I bought 2 copies so that I can be sure to have one on hand whenever I need it.  I cannot recommend this book enough!', \"Dad stretched the frog's tongue about 2 feet even before our granddaughter got to play/read the book. Amazing stretchy material.

It was a hit!', 'the book has lost its tongue but not its charm.  the children loved it! If you are a preschool teacher this book is a keeper.', 'This book was so much fun for my family.  Children love pulling the tounge back and then going \"SNAP\"!!!  I\\'ve never had a book you had to clean with water before.  HE HE HE!!!!  Cleaning is a little annoying, but not that much trouble.  Good story and cute drawings.', 'Dawn Bentley did a wonderful job of writing an entertaining story for preschool aged children. Although this is not one of my sons favorites, he does enjoy reading it from time to time. I think because he is three months shy of turning five, he is essentially outgrowing this cute, little story. When he was a little younger, he would ask me to read it again after we had read it once through already.', 'It was OK, but not a huge with a 5 year old; the 3 year old played with the tongue... not much for price, very small size book.', \"This is a great book. The poem flows smoothly as it's read with fun & enticing pictures. It has a cute storyline about a frog catching his dinner with a twist at the end!  A great book for little ones!\", 'Just know that the sticky tongue will be torn off within an hour of opening. I thought this book would be much larger. If I had known how small it would be, I would have gotten the $10 one.', \"The illustrations are bright and action packed, but then again so is the story.  This little frog gobbles up everything in sight until he unexpectedly meets his match.  My husband wasn't sure at first what to think about the frog's ill fated debut in our child's life but the book has earned its place in both of our hearts.  Its extremely fun to read aloud and even your under 12-monthers will love hearing the slurping whooping sounds.
