Their good intentions bring about delightful situations you will love.\"  -- Shari Brennan, Simegen.com\"This romantic comedy has all the elements--engaging characters, an adorable tale, and scenes that make you laugh out loud.\"  -- Laura Baker, award-winning author, Legend\\tBook #1 in the Fairy Godmother series\\tHolly Fuhrmann lives in Erie, PA and lives with one husband, four children, and one drooling Old English Mastiff, which makes her a leading authority on sanity-challenged writers.', \"Dream come true or worst nightmare? Grace Macguire can't figure out what in the world is going on, when three of the characters she'd created for recurring roles in her romance novels suddenly seem to come to life and decided that *she* is their next 'Cinderella Story.'On the pretense of doing research, Grace enlists the help of psychiatrist Dr. Max Aaronson, (and the fairy godmothers' choice for Grace's life-mate.) in an effort to really help her over her sudden bout of weird visions.Throw in some vile step-relatives and a really heinous individual who sees dollar signs in Grace's eyes and who, in my opinion, got off way too lightly and you have the makings for a enjoyable night of reading. I'd have liked the book to have been a bit longer, so that the characters could have been fleshed out more and the storyline beefed up, but all in all, a delightful story.\", \"It is a light hearted read, very Mills and Boone romance with a bit of quirky fairytale myth thrown in for free. It is exactly right if you are looking for an uncomplicated book that will make you smile and doesn't need you to work out the quantum physics of time travel or the validity of vampiric lifestyle choices. I think the concept would do well as a Disney or TV afternoon film. Fun read.\", \"Holly Fuhrman's MAD ABOUT MAX is a delightful blend of romance, humor, and fantasy.  A writer doubts her sanity when her own creations come to life -- and the resulting conversations will have readers laughing out loud.MAD ABOUT MAX is a perfect ending to a stressful day.  I highly recommend it!\", 'Although the dialog is well written and I was excited about the fairytale premise, I felt like I was watching a bad Lifetime movie.  You know the ones where you just want to throw up your hands and rewrite the screenplay.  If you are into that Lifetime super, sticky-sweet romance that is so predictable, then this is your romance book.  As for me I like some edgyness to my kidnappings and not the over the top psycho that deserves laughs more than shudders and gets off scot free in the end.I think this author has promise if she would please tighten up the plot and leave off some of the syrup.  Since this one was written in 2000 she may have done just that.', \"If you've always loved &quot;Cinderella&quot; and were/are a fan of the old TV series, &quot;Bewitched,&quot; then MAD ABOUT MAX is the book for you. As always in one of Ms.Fuhrmann's books, humor abounds in this tale of  Grace, a romance writer whose fictional characters come to life--three  fairy godmothers who are almost as bumbling as Samantha Steven's befuddled  aunt and every bit as loveable. The trio of well-meaning and marvelously  magical ladies set to work immediately on making Grace over and setting her  up with the perfect Price Charming for her.  Max is a psychiatrist so  handsome and charming, you'll wish you could spend some time on his couch.  Sit back and enjoy this delightful fantasy, secure in knowing the fun  doesn't stop with Max and Grace. Fern, Myrtle and Blossom will be at work  again in the upcoming sequel: MAGIC FOR JOY.  I can't wait.\", \"Grace Kelly MacGuire is a romance novelist.  She writes a series in which a trio of eccentric fairy godmothers help couples find love.  Suddenly, she finds that the trio has come to life, and only she can see them.  Naturally, she goes for psychiatric help.  She picks the doctor most likely to be old and grandfatherly, Dr. Artemus Aaronson, who turns out to be gorgeous and young, all this after winning a free makeover from a radio station she doesn't listen to.  Later she wins a new wardrobe, obviously the fairies have been busy.  She has both an evil stepmother and stepsister who want her trust fund and an evil would be husband, who wants her money.  All in all this is a really funny book, and I look forward to finally reading the rest of the series, Max's brother and sister are featured.\", \"This is a very light, short (around 2800 locations) read.  It's far from perfect.  I got a kick out of the reviewer who said he or she didn't have a problem with believing in the fairies but couldn't believe in the relationship.  I agree, lots in this book just happened too fast, it needed to be longer and more developed.But it was still entertaining.  The three bumbling fairy godmothers were a hoot.  As was watching Grace trying to figure out if she was crazy or not because she could see and hear them.  The stepmother and stepsister characters were delightfully evil.If you can suspend all disbelief and forgive the shortcomings, it's a nice little HEA romance that's worth the read.\"]\n"
